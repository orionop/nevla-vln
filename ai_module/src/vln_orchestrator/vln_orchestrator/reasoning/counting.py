"""Counting logic for the numerical (/1) question type.

Given the decomposed question and the set of 3D object instances from the
semantic map, return how many instances of the target class satisfy the
attribute and spatial-relation constraints.

The geometry/filter core is pure (numpy-only) and unit-testable off-robot with
synthetic instance lists. Only the *source* of instances (the live semantic map)
needs the Jazzy box. Scored 0/1 by exact match, so we bias toward the constraint
the question states rather than over-counting: an unconstrained "how many sofas"
returns every sofa; a constrained "sofas below a window" returns only those that
pass the relation against a window anchor.
